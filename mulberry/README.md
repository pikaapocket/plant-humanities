### Introduction

>"The only appropriate food for the silkworm is the leaf of the mulberry tree. It should be the first business therefore of the silk grower to provide himself with the source of a constant supply of mulberry leaves."[^1]

Addressing the House of Representatives on Thursday, February 24, 1831, Mr. Abel Wheeler, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, reported that the power and wealth of France were mainly derived from silk production and that a number of other European countries had embarked on the same path "with zeal."[^2]  Conversely, the United States was spending a fortune on foreign silk: between 1821 and 1825 the total value of imported silk was worth approximately $943,723,497 in today’s currency.[^3] To further his point, Mr. Wheeler compared this vast sum to the revenue generated from US bread exports: a paltry $5 million a year, or about $180 million today. Not only could mulberry leaves—the food of silkworms—be transformed into stacks of cash, but the mulberry tree itself was undemanding, requiring neither good soil nor good climate. [^4]

Despite investing years of effort, however, Wheeler’s dream of turning leaves into gold came to nothing. By the fall of 1839, the demand for mulberry trees had collapsed and thousands of acres of white mulberry plantations across Virginia and Georgia lay abandoned, their planters now destitute. [^5] 

Here we tell the story of loss, but also one of renewal and metamorphosis. In the shadows of the fields haunted by white mulberries rose the canopies of another tree: *Morus rubra*, the red mulberry native to North America. While its eastern relative, the white mulberry, has captured attention throughout history, both within and outside of its native ranges, the red mulberry has been overshadowed even in its home continent. Even though the red mulberry is found almost nowhere else in the world but North America, more often than not it is the white mulberry that comes to mind when we think of a mulberry tree.

The story of the red mulberry is a less glamorous one, certainly neither of princesses nor the dreams of riches promised by silk. A story earthier in its substance, more of trunk and twig, bark and berry, root and the breeze that gets caught in a generous canopy. These are the threads, certainly not of silk, but of Indigenous wisdom, landscapes of heritage and memory, in which the *Morus rubra*, as a tree in and of itself, is a horticultural marvel, medicine chest, source of food, fiber, wood, and respite. Neglected and overlooked for the most part because it was not the favorite food of the silkworm, the red mulberry tree is reclaiming its legacy on the landscapes of North America, but it faces multiple challenges; in Canada, it’s even an endangered species. It may not be the money tree of silk production like the white mulberry, but as we will discover, every part of the tree offers wealth of its own kind. [^6]

### Taxonomy, Genus, and Types of Mulberry
The mulberry genus *Morus* is part of the family *Moraceae*, which includes mulberries and figs. Even within mulberry species, morphology differs greatly, especially with the white mulberry, and it is unclear how many species listed in the genus are distinct, with estimates ranging from eight to seventeen.[^7] However, the three main types of mulberry are generally considered to be white, red, and black, the most common species of which are the *Morus alba*, *Morus rubra*, and *Morus nigra*.

The white mulberry (*Morus alba*) is believed to be native to East Asia and the Himalayas, although centuries of domestication and human movement have made it difficult to know its native range for certain. [^8] Less intensive human relationships have allowed more certainty to the whereabouts of the other groups’ native ranges: the red mulberry (*Morus rubra*) is from North America, while the black mulberry (*Morus nigra*) is from the area around the Caspian Sea in what used to be the Persian Empire. This narrative aims to focus on the white mulberry—most famous for its role in silk production—and the red mulberry, which, as we will discover, plays a less well-known but equally valuable role in North America’s biocultural heritage. [^9]

*Morus* trees bear long aggregate fruit, somewhat resembling a blackberry, which comes in various colors—green, white, red, black—and is rich in antioxidants. But the most historically significant, valuable part of the mulberry trees have been their leaves. Like the trees themselves, the leaves of the mulberry vary greatly in form, with leaf texture and shape ranging from shiny to matte, lobed or unlobed. Even on a single tree, there can be dozens of differently shaped leaves. For no other tree has the leaf been more valuable than the *Morus alba*. This species, characterized in one text as a "sociable and loyal" tree that is "used to being of service to others," is the mulberry whose leaves allow the silkworm to produce the best quality of silk. [^10]

### Sericulture, the Alchemy that Creates Raw Silk
It is the larvae of a species of moth called Bombyx mori, more commonly known as the silkworm, that produce silk. Over centuries of domestication, the once-wild silk moth Bombyx mandarina was bred into the familiar Bombyx mori, maintaining its preference for Morus alba leaves, while the white mulberry was bred to contain fewer tannins and more protein. [^11] For the blind, flightless larvae, the leaves of the white mulberry are one of the only foods they will eat and what they are most partial to; it follows that their cocoons are made from the secretions from two glands, which harden into a long fiber that’s rich in protein. [^12] 

Measuring anywhere between 600 and 900 meters in length, it is this filament that the worms produce which becomes the luxurious material known as silk. In order to prevent the precious thread from breaking when the adolescent moth emerges, the cocoons are steamed to kill the larvae, sometimes twisting the filaments from several cocoons together. [^13]

In the case of the non-violent silk Ahimsa, an alternative production method that uses silk left over after the moth has emerged from the cocoon, all the filaments that have been broken must be rejoined through twisting. The result in either case is a single strand of silk thread. [^14]
